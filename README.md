# Caesar Cipher Encoder and Decoder

This Python script provides a simple implementation of a Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. It includes two core functions:

	1.	caesar_encode: This function takes a message and an optional offset (default: 10) to encode the message by shifting each letter backwards in the alphabet by the specified offset.
	2.	caesar_decode: This function takes an encoded message and an optional offset (default: 10) to decode the message by shifting each letter forward in the alphabet by the specified offset.

Features:

	•	Customizable Offsets: The default shift value is set to 10, but you can provide your own shift value for both encoding and decoding.
	•	Non-alphabetic Characters: Any non-alphabetic characters (such as spaces or punctuation) are preserved as they are in the encoded or decoded message.

 How to Use:

	1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
	2.	Run the script using Python.
	3.	Modify the input message and offset in the function calls to customize your encryption or decryption process.
